The only\nchange that was made was following the upgrade steps as described on the SDN.</p>\n<p>After some help diagnosing from Sitecore support, they suggested adding a hidden setting\nto our configuration to see if it resolved the issue. This was the suggested setting to add:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"xml\"><pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>setting</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>ItemCloning.Enabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">value</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>false<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The impact of adding this setting is as expected, it disables the cloning functionality\n(you can read about Sitecore's cloning functionality in Section 4.6 of the\n<a href=\"https://sdn.sitecore.net/upload/sitecore7/72/content_author&#x27;s_cookbook_sc72-a4.pdf\">Content Author's Cookbook</a>). The other impact found was that the site start up time had returned to its previous speed and resolved the issue.</p>\n<p>The issue has been raised as a bug with the software and can be tracked using the reference\nnumber 436659 (for information on reference numbers you can read the <a href=\"https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/853187\">KB article</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update 29/10/2015</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sdn.sitecore.net/products/sitecore%20v5/sitecore%20cms%207/releasenotes/changelog/release%20history%20sc72.aspx\">release notes of Sitecore 7.2 Update-5</a> indicate that this issue has been resolved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The performance of the get item operation for both regular and clone items has been increased by introducing a separate shared field called ‘__Source Item’.
